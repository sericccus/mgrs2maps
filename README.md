A simple web app to create a google maps route from coordinates in the UTM-Ref, aka MGRS, geocoordinate standard.

On iOS, the route works fine in the Google Maps App. I have not tested it on Android, yet (19.06.24, 02:26, Berlin Time).

Made by GPT-4o, off my limitless patience, and for someone who gets shitty route descriptions on paper.
Gemini said it couldn't be done by the way. Something about SEO, paid services and someones developer program ... whatever.
