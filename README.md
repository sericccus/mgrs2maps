# mgrs2maps
A simple web app to create a google maps route from coordinates in the UTM-Ref, aka MGRS, geocoordinate standard.

Works on iOs.
Works on Android.

TODO:
- serve the site in different languages
- improve UI
- formatting the user input live (add spaces if user does not)
- accept different inputs
    - files, lists, strings
- create cli interface <3


Made by GPT-4o, off my limitless patience, and for someone who gets shitty route descriptions on paper.
Gemini said it couldn't be done by the way. Something about SEO, paid services and someones developer program ... whatever.
